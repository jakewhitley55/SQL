# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

# First, I determined the 10 most popular songs?
SELECT track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10
;

# Then I wanted to find the 5 most popular artists.
SELECT artist_name,
SUM(popularity) AS total_popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY total_popularity DESC
LIMIT 5
;

 # Next, I wanted to calculate the average tempo for the 10 most popular songs.
SELECT AVG(tempo) AS average_tempo
FROM (
 SELECT tempo
 FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
 ORDER BY popularity DESC
 LIMIT 10
) AS top_10_songs
;

# Then, I determined the average danceability by artist.
SELECT artist_name,
AVG(danceability) AS average_danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY average_danceability DESC
;

# Next, I wanted to see the Doja Cat song with the highest energy.
SELECT track_name,
energy
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Doja Cat'
ORDER BY energy DESC
LIMIT 1
;

# And finally, I determined the average popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track.
SELECT artist_name,
track_name,
AVG(popularity) AS avg_popularity,
AVG(danceability) AS avg_danceability,
AVG(energy) AS avg_energy
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name,
track_name
;
