--In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 


1. How many unique orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
;

2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product='iPhone'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
;

3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id=FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
;

4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT Product,
price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price IN (SELECT MIN(price) FROM JanSales)
;

5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January (rounded to the nearest cent)?
SELECT Product,
ROUND (SUM(Quantity*price),2) AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
;

6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product,
SUM(Quantity),
SUM(Quantity * price) AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product
;

7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers (rounded to the nearest cent)?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customers.acctnum) AS NumCustomers,
ROUND(AVG(Quantity*price),2) AS AvgAmountSpent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderID=customers.order_id
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND(FebSales.Quantity) > 2
;
